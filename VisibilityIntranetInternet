Issue: https://gitlab.cern.ch/webservices/webframeworks-planning/-/issues/505

For this issue what is required is an easy way to toggle the application to be only visibile to CERN or to the Internet.

What is needed to make this work is to change the types by adding a visibility field enum to indicate the values have to be
either cern or empty.

and adding to the resources some logic in GO to look for the visibilty field and if it's set to make the changes accordingly in the route.
