Chaos Engineering with Chaos Mesh.

Objective:As a standard objective of this procedure is to enforce some failures in the cluster and see where the vulnerabilities exist.

Experiment 1 Pod Failure:
As a very standard experiment on the cluster is to force kill a pod in a given namespace and see how the cluster reacts in terms of load balancing, and how long will it take until a new pod is created.

Experiment 1 Results: WIP
